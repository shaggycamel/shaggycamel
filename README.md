Hi there! I'm a Data Scientist with a keen interest in using analytics to understand human behaviour & sport science. I am also an advocate for the ethical use of data and take data privacy and model scrutinisation seriously.

### What am I up to? 

- I enjoy writing blogs and currrently have three: [my travel blog](https://shaggycamel-travelblog.netlify.app/), [music blog](https://shaggycamel.quarto.pub/freds_music_blog/), [NBA analytics blog](https://shaggycamel.quarto.pub/fantasy-2023/). All are created using a combination of R & Quarto. I have also authored an R package to streamline the creation and management of a blog, it can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/shaggycamel/blogme). 

- Analysing the NBA. I discovered the ESPN NBA datasets in 2022, they are rich, well structured sources of game, player, tournament & misc basketball data. I have taken up the challenge to model NBA player injury. Namely, to answer the questions: When will a player will become injured? What are the driving factors behind injury? And, after being injured, for how long will a player be unavailable to play? - It is a work in progress.

- New Zealand Political Donations.  In 2021 I collected donation declaration forms from all NZ policitical parties, and extracted the names of donors and the amount donated. I did this to better understand: Do any donors donate to multiple parties? And, who the donors are, for example, do they chair large corporations within NZ? - This project was an opportunity to structure my data in a graph database, and use graph algorithms to explore the common donors between parties.

- Twitter Analysis of Aus & NZ Politicians. In 2020, I started collecting tweets from politicians across Australia and New Zealand. This was done with the intention to condunt sentiment & topic analysis with regards to the parties each politican represents. I did this to better understand: Do politicians within a single party deliver different messages on twitter (party uniformity)? What type of topics do different parties tweet about, and does this align with their party outlook? - As a side-quest, I also monitored the increase/decrease of followers politicians expereinceed after a particularly explosive/sensible tweet.
